Hello! And merry Christmas (and/or happy Hanukkah)! It has been a little while since our last post (approximately 191 days). We will try to give you the major updates but will undoubtedly miss a few...

#### Theo updates

- Theo runs... non-stop. It's hard to imagine six months ago he could barely walk.
- He has also sprinted into toddler mode. While he is only 18 months, he does a very solid impression of a two-year old.
- Theo added a few new favorites:
  - __Outside:__ He just wants to go outside (where there are cats, parks, and fewer rules).
  - __Airplanes:__ Pronounced _air-mane_; Theo particularly enjoys watching [Space Racers](http://spaceracers.org/en) on Netflix and visiting airports. Seriously, he is the only person we know who enjoys airports. He evens seems fine with TSA.
  - __Dinos:__ Due to some confusion produced by the book [Dinotrux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinotrux), the term "dino" actually refers to two objects: dinosaurs and trucks.
  - __Trains:__ Enough said.
  - __Legos/Duplos:__ Allows him to combine his passions for construction and destruction with his passion for cars, planes, trucks, _etc._
  - __Cooking:__ Shelley introduced Theo to cooking, and he really enjoys helping out. Favorite food to make: popcorn (he really is Shelley's boy).
- In addition to cooking, Theo really enjoys helping with house chores. More than Shelley or Ed. He especially likes sweeping and pulling out the laundry.
- Theo had his first ear infection, which coincided with two flights on airplanes. His love of airplanes helped out a lot here.
- Theo has a ton of new words (we won't list them all here), but two of the most helpful have to be __yes__ and __no__; "no" shows up a lot more than "yes." Vigorous head shaking/nodding generally accompanies both words. He also has words for varieties of foods, drinks, and activities (_e.g._ "yellow" means coloring, since yellow is his favorite color). Shelley's favorite word from Theo's vocabulary: "thank YOU"—particularly when he uses it to return food that you attempted to feed him (we are working on "no thank you").
- Theo moved into a big-boy bed! This move occurred in October when Theo refused to sleep for several nights. We tried _nearly_ everything—including sleeping on the couch with him—until we realized the crib was the problem.
  - We now frequently wake to the sound of tiny footsteps running through our dark apartment.
  - One night (around 3am), Theo ran into our room, pushed a water bottle onto the bed, told Ed "thank you," and returned to his room to sleep.

#### Family updates

- We took our first non-holiday family vacation! We flew up to Seattle for a week and spent time with friends and family, and we also spent several days in Olympic National Park (pictures below).
- Ed passed his orals exam, which means he is ABD (all but dissertation). We've entered the final stretch (a really, really, really long final stretch). Target graduation date: May 2018. More realistic graduation date: May 2019, because...
- We are expecting again! Shelley is due on 21 April 2017. Details:
  - The doctor thinks the baby is a girl but wasn't entirely confident (about 90%).
  - The babe responds dramatically to food. A good eater will be welcome.
  - Shelley's parents (Norma and Norm) win the prize for best reaction: Norma repeatedly shouted, "OH---MY---**GOD**!" into the phone, while Norm congratulated Ed on being a stud (literally).

Please pray for us!
