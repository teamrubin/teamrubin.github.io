And we're back (in California... for a few weeks).

In case you missed [it](http://www.teamrubin.us/hello-from-nebraska/), we all traveled to Nebraska for Thanksgiving. Nebraska decided to start winter while we were visiting, so Thanksgiving was somewhat canceled: rather than heading out to the farm to see most of Ed's mom's side of the family, we hunkered down at Ed's folks' house for a nice meal, several naps, and more football games than Shelley lets Ed and Theo watch in a year. Everyone was happy. (Though we wish we could have seen many of the people we missed.)

Updates from the little guy:

- Theo met a lot more of Ed's family—including **three** great grandparents!
- Theo partook in Grandma Liz's bountiful Thanksgiving meal:
    - turkey (he liked immediately)
    - celery (he warmed up to)
    - mashed potatoes (maybe he'll like them in the future)
- Theo travels really well on planes (aside from forcing Ed to wash his pants)
- Theo loved visiting Nebraska so much, he decided he would stop sleeping—or sleep only in extremely short and infrequent intervals. We're kind of tired now.
- Some of Theo's best moments of sleep came while cuddling Dan.
- Theo experienced Nebraskans' voracious appetite for college football **and** the depths to which they sink following a loss.
- We discovered two things Theo particularly loves:
    - TV
    - ceiling fans
- And one thing he still hates:
    - baths (though he took one with his dad and seemed much happier, once Ed taught him how to splash)

And Theo met snow.
