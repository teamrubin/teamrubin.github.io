Howdy! We are still in Arizona, enjoying the Norms' hospitality and trying to figure out how we'll transport all of our Christmas goodies back to Berkeley. We considered buying a new car, but the title for our current car is in California. Several people have offered to take Theo off our hands. We're still planning to keep him.

More updates!

- More new foods!
    + Sour cream (makes spinach much easier)
    + Apple sauce
    + Cheese!
    + Steamed asparagus (strangely enough, asparagus appears to be his new favorite food)
    + Lettuce/cabbage
    + Oatmeal (not a huge hit)
    + Pumpkin bread, pumpkin pie, and candied yams ([again](http://www.teamrubin.us/sunny-arizona-i/), all Grandpa Norm)
- Theo celebrated his first Christmas! We attended the vigil Mass (translation: we went to church on the 24th), where Theo managed to capture the attention of the entire family behind us.
    + Theo (and we) made out like a fat rat: terrific toys and cute clothes galore! Toys included a Koosh ball, a football, a crazy wooden bungee contraption, a butterfly that sings, a trilingual mini piano, a roadkill skunk, and a zombie whose arms fall off when shot with a pistol (the latter two, of course, came from Grandpa Norm).
    + The little guy met more of the folks on Norms' side of the family; he particularly liked Shell's cousin Linda, who has long hair (for grabbing) and long nails (for back-scratching).
    + We visited several pretty impressive Christmas light displays (see the animatronic Santa below).
- We are still working our way through the family's first cold. We're through the worst of it, but there is still a lot of congestion...
- Which brings us to new things that Theo hates:
    + the snot sucker
    + having his face wiped
    + mushy turkey
- Theo's love for jumping in his bouncer continues to grow. Today he fell asleep while jumping and continued to wake up for a few jumps before falling back to sleep.
- Theo threw up on Ed's face. 🤑
- Theo's new vocal stylings: "DADADADADADA."

Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
