It's been awhile since our last blog. Sorry! As of today, Theo has finished being zero-years old and moved on to being one! Unbelievable. Thank you to all of you who have given us love and support and prayers (and cookies) throughout the last year (plus). We love you all and could not/would not have survived without you. A very special thank you to our moms and dads.

#### Theo updates from the last four months

- Theo started walking! He only takes a few steps at a time, but we imagine that will change quickly.
- We're up to eight teeth! Plus, a molar is slowly working its way out. When Ed asked Shelley where the molar was, she told him it was in the back of his mouth.
- Theo has a new favorite food: banana (further evidence that he is a minion). He likes bananas so much, he has decided all food will go by the name of "nana." He also really likes pizza and spaghetti.
- Theo has started communicating! We're not sure we can call it English, but he definitely has words. The dictionary of Theo's language.
  - __baba__ (noun): used interchangeably for other babies, a bottle, and Shelley's boob
  - __bow__ (noun): as in "bow-wow"; originally used for dogs; now used for any animal; occasionally used for people on bikes
  - __dada__ (noun/exclamation): generally used in the specific context that Ed has left the room
  - __lala__ (exclamation): Theo's singing
  - __light__ (noun/adjective): originally used for actual lights; now also used as an adjective to describe bright areas
  - __mama__ (noun): any adult that provides some sort of care for Theo; especially Shelley
  - __nana__ (noun): any sort of food and often drink
  - __woah__ (exclamation): Theo's reaction to a large variety of experiences---especially his accomplishments; see also "wow"
  - __wow__ (exclamation): Theo's reaction to a large variety of experiences---especially his accomplishments; see also "woah"
- Theo also understands the meaning of the word "No," but the effect of the word lasts about three seconds. He also sometimes says "yeah" and "nah." For a period, Theo would say "meow" and "roar" for cats and dragons, respectively, but now everything is just "bow."
- Theo still loves books. And socks. At the moment, he spends a lot of time reading our cookbooks.
- Theo and Shelley __love__ playing hide-and-seek together.
- Theo visited the zoo for the first time! He particularly enjoyed the lemurs and orangutans.
- Theo also had a great time at his first baseball game! We all went to a College World Series game. He stayed until the 7th inning.

## Pictures!

Because so much time has passed since our last post, we are posting pictures by month.
