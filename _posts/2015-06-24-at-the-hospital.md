Our little guy left the safety of Shelley's womb and entered the world at approximately 9pm on Friday, June 29<sup>th</sup>. He came out a bit larger than expected---8 pounds and 1 ounce; 21.5 inches long (tall). Shell predicted the 'long baby,' but we were both pretty surprised he made it to eight pounds (Shell claims at least four pounds are cookies).

**Official name:** Theodore Raymond Joseph Rubin

where 'Raymond' comes from Ed's mom's dad and 'Joseph' comes from Shell's mom's dad (and also a pretty stellar saint). The name seems to lend itself perfectly to diminuitives...

**Unofficial names used so far:**

- Theo <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">("preferred name" by Shell)</span>
- Theo-bot <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Shell and Ed)</span>
- Theo-saur <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(think dinosaur; from Shell and Ed)</span>
- Teddy/Ted <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(Shell is attempting to corral 'Ted'-users toward Theo)</span>
- Teddy Ray <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Norm)</span>
- Big T <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Mike)</span>
- T Man <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Ed)</span>
- Ray J <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Ed; retired)</span>
- (Little) Mr. Man <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Shelley)</span>
- Buddha Baby <span style="color: #b4b4b4;">(from Shelley)</span>

And now for a bunch of pictures from our stay at the hospital....
