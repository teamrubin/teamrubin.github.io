The posts were getting a bit too far apart—with quite a lot of pictures to load—so we're attempting to share pictures and updates a bit more frequently.

Last week we celebrated Shelley's most recent birthday (to figure out how old she is, take your age, divide by 5, add 12.5, divide by π, convert to radians, multiply by 0, then add 30). For Shell's birthday, we all headed up the coast to Fort Bragg. 

Over the birthday weekend, Theo 

- rolled around the cabin
- sat/slept on the deck
- worried about the buzzards that circled the cabin (something dead in his diaper?)
- loved looking out the loft's windows to see the forest
- slept like a boss (he really likes hot places, and the wood-burning stove ensured the loft was hot)

After the trip, Shelley's mom (Norma a.k.a. *Sitto*) came to town to see her favorite grandson (and help mom and dad weather the no-nanny week). Norma and Theo spent a lot of time hanging out. In addition to hanging out with his Sitto, Theo

- attacked a bag of Twix
- figured out his jumper chair (so much so that he developed a blister on his baby toe)
- got his most recent round of shots
- continued eating his hands and started playing with his tongue
- saw some giant fish kites at the marina
