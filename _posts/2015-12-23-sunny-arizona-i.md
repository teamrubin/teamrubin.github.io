Howdy folks! Berkeley started to get a bit too cold for us, so we followed the snowbirds' route down to Phoenix and into Shell's parents (*the Norms*) warm basement. Ed caught a cold as we rolled into Phoenix, Theo followed with his first-ever sickness, and it looks like Shell is bringing up the caboose. Besides catching his first-ever cold, here are a few more Theo updates:

- Lots of new foods!
  - Theo **loves** peanut butter, bananas, yogurt, chicken, turkey, avocado, and... chocolate (we know... Grandpa Norm pushed very hard for the chocolate). Boob juice still tops his list.
  - Theo will eat just about anything else: spinach, carrots, celery, eggs, paper, *etc.*
  - Theo hates grape- and cherry-flavored Tylenol
- Theo experienced the desert. We went for a brief jaunt in Joshua Tree National Park—we drove through the park *en route* to Phoenix—but his first real desert walk happened here in Shell's beloved Sonoran Desert.
- Solid poop! It's really stinky.
- Norm taught Theo how to play the drums, and Shell taught him a little piano.
- Theo opened his first Christmas presents
  - Stacking cups and books from his Grandma Liz and Grandpa Dan.
  - Very cute hat and outfits from his Aunt Jen and Uncle Mike.
- Theo doesn't hate baths anymore!

Now for the pictures! (There are three pages.)
