Wow... it's been a while since our last post. We hope 2016 is treating all of you well. Theo prepared a brief statement for you all. After the statement are a few more updates about the little guy.

#### Theo's message:

fcevn kjj5fnv cfcv j ji brg rbdvb xe4fcxcz~A

#### More Theo updates:

- Four teeth! Top and bottom front teeth appeared this month. A fifth tooth (canine) is about to erupt.
- Theo has greatly improved his fine motor skills: it takes him about 2 seconds to rip off unwanted hats and throw them on the ground. He also pinches pretty well.
- Theo recently discovered his _boyhood_. It is one of his favorite bath-time toys.
- Solid foods galore: Theo will eat just about anything—except mashed potatoes.
- Theo really like drinking water from a glass. If he is getting really fussy at the dinner table and refuses to eat, try giving him a glass of water. He opens his mouth wider than you knew possible and then laps at the glass like a puppy. Very cute.
- He is also using straws. We gave his a _silly straw_ (lots of loops), and he carries it around with him (including diaper changes and bath times).
- Theo is _almost_ crawling. He inches a bit and is army crawling a lot, but he has yet to put it all together.
- Theo is a talker. Especially when other people are talking. This babbling makes Skype calls fun and church difficult.
- Four of Theo's current loves:
  1. Banging things together. Currently he is slamming a plastic cup on the side of the tub. He also loves clapping. Clapping while holding things that will make noise might be his favorite.
  2. Standing up. In the bath tub, in his crib, while nursing—he just loves standing. And looks pretty proud of himself whenever he does it.
  3. Spoons.
  4. His feet.

## Pictures!

It turns out not posting for two months means we have a lot (three pages) of pictures to share. Enjoy!
