Theo Burrito turns one week old today! To commemorate this monumental occasion, we decided to write another post.

Theo's arrival has definitely changed how Team Rubin operates. While some of these changes are challenging---we previously did not have a screaming and squirming tiny man demanding food every two hours---Shell and I truly are really, really happy. We thought we would share with you some of Theo's little quirks:

- Like most babies, Theo generally hates diaper changes. However (or perhaps for this reason), he does not let us know when he dirties his diaper. So far there have only been two victims to his surprise pee attacks during changing: a pediatrician and himself.
- Theo loves his left hand. Only the tightest of swaddles can prevent Theo's mouth and his left arm from reuniting---even velcro swaddles struggle to contain his mania.
- Grandpa Norm is convinced Theo enjoys the 'Burner' entertainment (referring to Burning Man, for those of us who are not in the know) he provides for Theo. This entertainment includes psychadelic lightbulbs, a pimped out crib, and trance birthing music.
- While we've yet to introduce Theo to much pop music, he still responds dramatically to epic soundtracks/classical pieces (John Williams, Wagner, Bach, *etc.*). Before birth, he would dance and kick with the music; now music soothes him while he tries to latch, and he nurses to the beat.
- Theo loves being held. This fact might be true for all babies, but we're happy about it either way. Shell thinks it may have something to do with her addiction to cuddling that long predated the little guy.

In the last few days, Theo hung out his maternal grandparents (Norm and Norma), a few of our friends, fought his way out of several swaddles, and played with his mom. Now for what everyone actually wants (*i.e.* photos).

Proof Theo is not *always* happy/calm.
