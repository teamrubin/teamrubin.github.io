Theo is four months old! All the things we want to say are the things we constantly hear parents—including our own parents—saying all of the time:

- He's getting so big!
- He's growing so fast!
- He's just so freaking cute!
- How did he manage to puke on my pants!?!

While his cuteness and size are both substantial and impressive—his parents are definitely not biased, either—Theo has some more *firsts* to share with y'all:

- Theo visited Yosemite National Park for the first time! It was also Ed's first time and one of the few items on Ed's bucket list. 
- Theo stayed in his first hotel! (same trip)
- Theo now can roll from front to back and back to front. And he is scooting a bit (he rolls he legs up behind him like a scorpion and then drags his body forward in some kind of no-legged army crawl). While rolling and inching are not terribly impressive to most adults, these developments are pretty awesome and frightening to us.
- Theo celebrated his mommy's (thirtieth) birthday!
- Theo took his first ambulance ride! In a demonstration of his flailing abilities and strength, the little guy knocked some freshly brewed coffee onto his face. He got a few burns, but Theo is all healed up.
- Theo is now at the stage where he puts **everything** into his mouth. Except for his milk and saliva—those go everywhere but his mouth. We're working on it.
- Theo's eyes appear to have cleared up and gained some strength: he makes eye contact from across the room (again, probably not impressive to non-parents) and sits/contemplates new places like a hawk.
- Theo has developed a pretty awesome sense of humor:
    + Mommy putting things on her head is very funny
    + Mommy singing and dancing is hilarious
    + Dad making funny sounds is... funny
    + Dad making roaring sounds is funny
    + Mommy making roaring sounds is either funny or terrifying
- Theo also likes to make noises with us in a pretty awesome call-and-response of shouts and squawks. One of his first such episodes was in the middle of a quiet library.
- Theo watched his first few minutes of football. He screamed as we pulled him away from the television's tractor beam.
- Theo got a bouncy chair! (videos forthcoming)
