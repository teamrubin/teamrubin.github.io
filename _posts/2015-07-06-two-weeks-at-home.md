Theo has now survived two full weeks at home with us! Granted, most of the daylight hours have been supported by his maternal grandparents---the Norms---but I think we can be proud of at least one accomplishment: Child Protective Services have not taken any of us away.

This week, Theo not only overcame his circumcision, but he was the only one of the three of us that did not nearly faint during the procedure. We were all scarred by the experience in different ways. We are also learning how to work with Theo's propensity for very frequent pooping and his penchant not letting us know when he's pooped. Despite these challenges facing the little man, it appears as though Theo has decided to keep us. I say this for a few reasons:

1. He still snuggles with us and sleeps in our arms. And he is a very good snuggler (evidence below).
2. He is marking his territory all over us and the apartment. We are considering moving the changing table outdoors to save our apartment's drywall. Just this morning he pooped in our sink and peed in my water glass.
3. He has gained approximately a pound since he left the hospital---no evidence of a hunger strike.
4. He let us sleep four straight hours (once) this week.

Not all of his week was burdensome. In addition to getting another week with Shelley's parents (the aforementioned Norms), Theo also met his grandpa Dan (Ed's dad), took several walks, played with his parents (or at least tolerated his parents as they played with him), made several new friends, danced with his mom, and went out to eat a few times. He also did a whole lot of sleeping and eating.

For the record: there was never a question whether we would keep him---just look at him!
