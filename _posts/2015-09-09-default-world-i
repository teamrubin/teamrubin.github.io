It's been a little while since our last post. Things have been getting a bit busier (I'm told this trend will continue):

- Shell is now back to work for 3–4 days a week. We cannot tell who likes Shell's days home with Theo more—Theo or Shelley. Either way, there is a lot of dancing.
- Ed is back to school (again). The family joke is that it is a race between Ed finishing school and Theo starting school. I think the betting has it at 50-50.
- Theo [figured out how to roll over](https://vimeo.com/137560595)!
- Ed's parents (Dan and Liz), Ed's sister and brother-in-law (Jenny and Mike), and our friend (Father Scott Harter) visited us for [Theo's Baptism](https://vimeo.com/137566126). Father Scott celebrated the Mass and Baptism. We had a great time visiting breweries, cooking steaks, and catching up.
- Theo is working on (1) sitting by himself and (2) [blending into the futon](https://vimeo.com/137784851). I think he's better at (2).
- There have been a lot more smiles and laughs, and Theo is [learning how to play with toys](https://vimeo.com/137785370)!
- Theo had his first day of childcare—he hung out with a buddy and their nanny. The nanny reported that Theo slept almost the entire day except when he screamed for food. Sounds like the little guy we know and love.
- The little man is getting better at sleeping during the night. He hit seven hours a few times. If only his parents went to bed when he went to bed...
- The little guy is also getting better at spitting up his milk on us.
- Ed added "The Chunk" to Theo's list of nicknames.

A few more firsts for Theo (besides meeting Aunt Jenny and Uncle Mike, meeting Father Scott, being baptized, rolling over, and spending the day with a nanny):

- Theo experienced an earthquake! (He slept through it.)
- Theo stood in grass (with Shell's help)
- Theo visited a vineyard (like a true Northern California babe)
- Theo met a lot of Ed's classmates at the department picnic
- Theo visited the Census data lab where his dad works
- Shelley taught Theo about misty mornings
- Berkeley taught Theo about the problems associated with 95-degree days withough air conditioning
- Theo peed on Shelley (for the 100th time)
- Theo went to a birthday party
- Theo met a doggy!
- Theo developed preferences for books (Ed and Shelley can recite *Moo, Baa, La La La* by heart)
