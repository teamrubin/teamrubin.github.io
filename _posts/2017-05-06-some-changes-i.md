Greetings! Some time has passed since our last blog post, and during that time, we've had a few changes.

For example, Shelley gave birth to an amazing little girl on April 6^th^! That baby's name? Clara Marie Antonia Rubin. Clara entered the world approximately two weeks before we were expecting her but still weighed a respectable 6 pounds and 6.7 ounces. Clara and Shelley both recovering amazingly quickly. Clara eats well, sleeps pretty well, poops really well, and, more generally, is awesome. We can't wait for you to meet her.

Theo is coming up on two years of age, and, from time-to-time, his behavior might give you a hint at this proximity to two. He's still the book-loving, music-loving, food-hating, joyful little guy we love, but he's added a few new tricks to his bag. For instance,

- __One, less favorable, trick__: if you make him mad enough, then he will throw a toy at you, while he glares deeply into your soul. And he throws surprisingly accurately/hard—particularly when the toy is a diecast dump truck. His throwing skills are quickly approaching Shelley's level.
- __A more positive trick__: Theo figured out how to play the harmonica (and blow bubbles—they're very similar)! Shelley very accurately predicted that Theo would love music. He's still working on saying, "harmonica"—four-syllable words still present some challenges.

A few more quick updates:

- Theo fully entered his construction-equipment obsession phase. He has a 20-truck fleet that includes a pretty impressive crane, and his bed-time song is _The Wheels on the Bobcat_ (sung to the tune of _The Wheels on the Bus_).
- Shelley is on maternity leave until July. The Norms came to help us acclimate to life with two children and were hugely helpful. Liz comes soon!
- Ed is still in school.
