Another week has passed, and our appreciation for our parents---and all parents---continues to grow. Our little man has moved from *rarely fussy* to *frequently fussy*, but we still think he's great. His Grandma Liz (Ed's mom) is now in town, and she is helping a lot with Theo's fussy spells.

A few updates from Theo's most recent week:

- The little man appears to have undergone a growth spurt (perhaps explaining some of the fussing): Theo now weights 9 pounds, 9.5 ounces and measures 22 inches long (up from his birthweight of 8 pounds, 1 ounce and birth length of 21.5 inches). Way to go Shelley and Theo!
- Theo is cooing and attempting to smile. We spent time with friends who have a 9-month-old daughter who smiled and giggled the entire time we saw her; something to look forward to!
- All of Grandpa Norm's exercises appear to be paying off: Theo holds his head up unassisted for short periods of time, before bobbling around and falling over like a tiny drunk man. He also occasionally grasps our hands and pulls himself up (slightly).
- Theo still sleeps pretty well. Most nights he sleeps 3.5--4 hours and then another 2.5--3 hours after feeding.
- A few more nicknames to add to the original list:
    + Bean Man
    + Bean Burrito (particularly when he is swaddled)
    + T Bird
    + T Money
    + T Bot
    + Turd Bot (particularly while pooping on tables)
    + Sweet Pea (Pee?)
- Regarding Sweet Pee: Theo demonstrates prodigious peeing abilities. He has the accuracy of a sniper with a draw that would shame Billy the Kid. **Example:** We were meeting friends Friday evening. After a quick bath, we opened Theo's towel. Without pause, Theo peed all over Shell (his favorite target). She was standing several feet away.
