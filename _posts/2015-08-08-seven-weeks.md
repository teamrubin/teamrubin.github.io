Theo now has seven weeks under his belt and is ruling the apartment with a strong, poorly coordinated fist. 

Updates from the past few weeks:

- Theo's acne is clearing up, and his tiny peach fuzz hair is growing nicely. He still has a mullet.
- Shelley went back to work on Monday (August 3rd). Either in retaliation or to demonstrate that he still controls our apartment, Theo promptly peed on Ed three times.
- Theo had several visitors from Nebraska. During these visits, Theo
    1. checked out his first brewery ([Faction Brewing](http://factionbrewing.com) in Alameda),
    2. visited the redwoods in Muir Woods (Theo also visited the redwoods on Shelley's last day before work),
    3. experienced the ocean, where he also confirmed his hatred for cold water.
- Shelley's biggest highlight: helping Theo figure out he can swing his arms. There is no stack of blocks safe from the wrath of Theo and Shell. Shelley also set up a clothing-drying rack with hanging toys under which Theo lays and flails his arms. He's a pretty lucky guy.
- Theo is also becoming a bit more vocal. Cooing!
- Often before he goes to bed, Theo gets smiley. On the nights he doesn't get smiley, Theo demonstrates his improved screaming and flailing abilities.
- Theo upped his record for consecutive hours slept to five hours.
- We're finding that Theo inherited his mom's introverted tendencies: While he loves playing and being held, there are times he likes to be alone. Apparently even infants find there is such a thing as too much parent time---we're prepping for a teenager.


Because we took so long to get this post together, **we have twice the number of pictures!** 

(There is a second page of awesome Theo pictures.)
